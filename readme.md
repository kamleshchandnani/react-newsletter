#### usage

We need to create a new issue for every week based on date in `/issues` folder. It uses markdown, so you can use headings, images, lists, links, etc.

It will be picked up automatically by a cron running on travisCI

&nbsp;

#### development

- Clone this repo and run npm install

- The styles sit in `template/styles.css`

- You can run `npm run print` to create a `test.html`
  This is a sample file to see how will the email look. Emails are very limiting, so things might not look exactly how they look in html

- You can run `npm run sample` to send a test email to yourself
  This is the only reliable test. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and get a mailchimp token from @siddharthkp
